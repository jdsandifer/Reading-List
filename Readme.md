# Reading List
This is a list of books and articles I'm currently reading, I'm intending to read, or I've read already.

They're all about software development in some way or another and - most importantly - they 
contain age-old wisdom from experienced developers.

I go to the Internet and people around me to find out the latest information about a current 
language, framework, or tool. However, I usually go to books to find wisdom and information that hasn't 
changed (much) througout the history of software development. (Although I sometimes find that on the Internet, too.)

## Learning to Code
Just in case you found this while trying to learn to code, I want to add my advice on that subject:

[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)

That's really the only advice I think you need. Go through the certification programs in order - they're 
completely FREE - and do the projects completely. This is key - make real things and don't start the next 
thing until you've got the current one working and in a "finished" state (something you'd be happy to show 
off in an interview or to your family and friends).

I would also recommend not skipping any of the challenges or projects. If you've already learned the material, 
you can skip the intros and just do the steps to get the tests to pass. (It'll either go really quickly or 
you'll realize you didn't understand it as well as you thought and can go back and review the information.) 
They also have a great forum if you need help on the projects.

## Currently Reading
I'm currently going through the Epic React course to level up my skills in that area so I'm not reading 
anything else right now.

## Books I Recommend
This is really hard because there are a lot of great books out there. 
However, I do want to have a list of books I can whole-heartedly recommend to anyone interested in improving their skills.
This list is comprised of the best of the best, with special emphasis on how widely applicable the information is.
I've also made sure each of these books is one I'd like to have on my shelf - for my reference or so I can lend it out easily.
I've listed these roughly in the order that I would recommend them to a beginner and listed why I'd recommend them.

- Learning how to learn: *Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman* by Dave H. Hoover & Adewale Oshineye
- What good code looks like: *Clean Code*
- How to work with others: *The Ideal Team Player: How to Recognize and Cultivate The Three Essential Virtues* by Patrick Lencioni
- Getting a job (and algorithms): *Cracking the Coding Interview*
- More advanced ideas (OOP): *Head First Design Patterns*
- Lessons from expert programmers: *97 Things Every Programmer Should Know: Collective Wisdom from the Experts*

## Just for Fun
This readme is not only something to read, 
but also contains a list of things to read. It's a readme of readme's! :-)
