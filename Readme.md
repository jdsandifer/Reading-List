# Reading List
This is a list of books and articles I'm currently reading, I'm intending to read, or I've read already.

They're all about software development in some way or another and - most importantly - they 
contain age-old wisdom from experienced developers.

I go to the Internet and people around me to find out the latest information about a current 
language, framework, or tool. However, I usually go to books to find wisdom and information that hasn't 
changed (much) througout the history of software development. I sometimes find that on the Internet, too.

## Books I Recommend
This is really hard because there are a lot of great books out there. 
However, I do want to have a list of books I can whole-heartedly recommend to anyone interested in improving their skills.
So this list is comprised of the best of the best, with special emphasis on how widely applicable the information is.
I've also made sure each of these books is one I'd like to have on my shelf - for my reference or so I can lend it out easily.
I've listed these roughly in the order that I would recommend them to a beginner.
