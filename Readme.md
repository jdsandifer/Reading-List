# Reading List
This is a list of books I'm currently reading, I'm intending to read, or I've read already.

They're all about software development in some way or another and - most importantly - they 
contain age-old wisdom from experienced developers.

I go to the Internet and people around me to find out the latest information about a current 
language, framework, or tool. However, I usually go to books to find wisdom and information that hasn't 
changed (much) througout the history of software development. (Although I sometimes find that on the Internet, too.)

## Just for Fun
This "Readme" is awesome because it's not only something to read, 
but also contains a list of things to read. It's a readme of readme's!

I enjoy stuff like that. :-)
